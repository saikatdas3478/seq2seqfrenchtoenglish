# seq2seqfrenchtoenglish

I have made a Machine Translation model with Recurrence-based Seq2Seq architecture to translate French texts to English texts. 
The model uses single layer of LSTM layer in the encoder and single layer of decoder for seq-2-seq recurrence.

The dataset I've used comes from Tatoeba, a collection of sentence translations in a variety of languages sourced from volunteers: https://tatoeba.org/en
